# Library_and_Person

Welcome to my GitHub repository for my library simulation project! 
This project simulates the workings of a library and allows users
to create multiple libraries, books, and users.

Books can be created and added to a library, but duplicate books cannot 
be added to the same library. However, users can create new book objects 
with the same attributes, but different IDs, and add them to the library.

Users can also borrow books from the library, allowing them to keep 
track of their borrowing history and current borrowings.

This simulation aims to provide users with an experience similar to 
that of a real library, allowing them to manage multiple libraries 
and books, as well as track their borrowings and returns.
